# replay_exploration
dis is me jus lookin at da datas

# Installation/Setup
- Python 3.7 or later (I'm using Python 3.10.11)
- clone dis repo
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Drop your replay file(s) into the da folder called `data`
- Rename the replay file to something shorter for ease of use (optional)

You might have to pip install some extra packages I haven't updated the `requirements.txt` in months...
